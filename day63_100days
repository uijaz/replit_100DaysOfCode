# Specs:
# - Create a library from subroutines used in the programs from the files day1_100days.py to day62_100days.py.
# - Go through all the programs and choose the regularly used subroutines to create a library and reference within all these programs.
# - Create a new file that contains all these subroutines.
# - Import this library into all the programs and create relevant imports.


# Implementation:
- Created utils_100days.py.
- Moved the most commonly used functions to utils_100days.py.
- Imported utils_100days.py into all the relevant programs.
- Updated the functions to use the imported functions from utils_100days.py.
