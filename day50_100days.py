# Day 50 - Project Day: Idea Storage

# GPT instructions:

# The program for idea storage system should:
# 1. Prompt the user to add an idea, or load a random one.
# 2. Choosing 'Add an idea' results in:
# 2a. A prompt for the user to input their idea.
# 2b. Add the idea to a text file called 'myideas.txt'.
# 2c. Add the idea in append mode, with every new idea on a brand new line.
# 2d. Choosing 'Load random' results in:
# 3. Load the list of ideas.
# 3a. Choose one at random.
# 3b. Display it on screen for a few seconds.
# 3c. Return to the menu.
# - To pick an idea at random, you could use split() to get an array of values. Or you could use random.choice to generate a random number and keep loading lines until you get to the random number line.
# - Try implementing your menu as a subroutine, so you can call it whenever you need to return to it.

# Example output:
# ðŸŒŸIdea StorageðŸŒŸ
# 
# Add an idea or see a random idea? a/r. > r
# 
# Monkey tennis.
# 
# Add an idea or see a ranmdom idea? a/r. > a
# 
# Input your idea. > Youth hostelling with Chris Eubank
# 
# Nice! Your idea has been stored.

# Additional improvements:
# Improve the program to allow for the user to list all ideas, or quit the program.
# Add newlines to the output to make it easier to read.
