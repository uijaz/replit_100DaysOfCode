# Day 64: OOP

# Specs:
# - Create a generic 'job' class.
# - The init method of 'job' will store the details for name, salary and hours worked.
# - 'job' will have another method that prints those details nicely.
# - Create two sub-classes from 'job': 'doctor' and 'teacher'
# - The 'doctor' subclass should include 'speciality' and 'years of experience' methods.
# - The 'teacher' subclass should include 'subject' and 'position'.
# - The print methods for each sub-class should print this extra data.
# - Instantiate a lawyer, a computer science teacher, and a pediatric doctor with 7 years of experience.
# - Output the information for each job.

# Example output:
