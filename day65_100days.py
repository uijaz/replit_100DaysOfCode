# Day 65: Character Creation

# Specs:
# - This is a game that will have characters, enemies and players.
# - This game needs to have a 'character' class with attributes of 'name', h'ealth' and 'magic points'.
# - This class needs these values setup when it is initialized.
# - It then needs a method to output this data.
# - There is a sub-class 'player' which inherits from 'character' and also has an attribute of 'number of lives'.
# - Player should also have an 'am I alive?' method which checks the player status and reports back yes or no.
# - There is also an 'enemy' sub-class with additional attributes of 'type' and 'strength'.
# - 'enemy' should have two sub-classes:
# -- 'orc' with a 'speed' attribute.
# -- 'vampire' with a 'day/night' tracker.
# - Instantiate the game and ask the user to name one player, two vampires and three orcs.
# - Print out their values.
